# breaking_files

I usually deal with huge .sav files at work, so I wrote this function to break those files into smaller pieces, then I could open them with MS Excel.

# breaking_tables

This function breaks a .docx file with multiple tables and returns a list containing those tables, as long as those tables are not pasted
as images. 

# week_number

This function counts the number of weeks in a vector with week days in Portuguese.

# growth_rate

This functions calculates the yearly rate of growth in a population. It is vectorized, so in case you have multiple populations for each year it is going to give the growth rate between the corresponding pairs.
