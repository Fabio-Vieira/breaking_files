# breaking_files

I usually deal with huge .sav files at work, so I wrote this function to break those files into smaller pieces, then I could open them with MS Excel.

# breaking_tables

This function breaks a .docx file with multiple tables and returns a list containing those tables, as long as those tables are not pasted
as images.
